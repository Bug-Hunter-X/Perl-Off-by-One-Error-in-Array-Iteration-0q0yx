This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Perl when iterating over arrays using foreach loops and the $#array index. The `bug.pl` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.pl` provides the corrected version.  The error occurs because $#array returns the last index of the array, so the loop goes one step beyond the valid range. The solution uses a more idiomatic way of iterating using foreach, which prevents this issue.
